A simple quiz gui. There are 10 questions and it keeps score. It uses the Trivia API to generate the true or false questions and tkinter to make the gui. It was focused on using OOP and calsses to practice using them.

**Highlights:**
FOund the trivia database which was fun to go thorugh and it's nice pushing and learning different design concepts with OOP.
